# IE437 HW3 – Data-Driven Design Optimization

A Bayesian optimization project implementing and comparing surrogate models (MLP, GP, NeMO, COMs, RoMA) for design optimization.

## Overview

This assignment explores neural moment-based and Gaussian Process surrogates for data-driven optimization with uncertainty quantification.

## Key Components

- **Surrogate Models**: MLP, Gaussian Process, NeMO, COMs, RoMA variants
- **Shared Backbone**: PyTorch MLP backbone with task-specific heads
- **Uncertainty Quantification**: Probabilistic predictions and calibration analysis
- **Bayesian Optimization**: Acquisition functions and optimization loops

## Project Structure
